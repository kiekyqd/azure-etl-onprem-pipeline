# Azure End-to-End Data Engineering Project: From On-Prem to Cloud Analytics
## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to build a **fully automated data pipeline on Azure** to extract, process, and visualize **customer and sales data** from an **on-premises SQL Server database**.

## Learning & Inspiration
I followed the methodologies and processes demonstrated by **[Mr.K Talks Tech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ41WqhHglk)** and **[Luke J Byrne](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygJ11fzq_ik)**, adapting their approaches to implement my own **Azure-based data pipeline**.

Through this hands-on experience, I gained a deeper understanding of **Azure Data Factory, Databricks, Synapse Analytics, and Power BI**, while also customizing the workflow to align with real-world business use cases.

## Business Requirements
The company aims to gain deeper insights into its customer demographics, particularly the gender distribution of its customer base and its impact on product sales. With a vast amount of customer data stored in an on-premises SQL database, stakeholders require a comprehensive KPI dashboard to analyze sales trends.

This dashboard should:

- Provide a breakdown of total products, total customers, and overall sales revenue.
- Visualize customer distribution and sales revenue by gender.
- Enable users to filter sales data by product category and interactively explore data by gender.
- Offer a user-friendly interface for seamless analysis.

By implementing this solution, stakeholders can make data-driven decisions and better understand how customer demographics influence sales performance.
